	W_WEIGHT 	Weight 
Weight 
Numeric variable. This weight is aimed at adjusting some sociodemographic characteristics in the sample population to the distribution of the target population. It has been computed using the marginal distribution of Age, Sex, Education and Region. 
	S018 	Equilibrated weight-1000 
Equilibrated weight-1000 

Numeric variable [makes the sample size of all countries equal to the same amount of N=1000]. Equilibrated weights have been calculated using the formula: 1.000/sample size. Equilibrated weight can be used when all countries and territories involved in the analysis are required to be treated as equal units, regardless of their population or sample size. The weights to be used are the product of the W_WEIGHT and S018.
